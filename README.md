*MarineGym* is a large-scale parallel framework designed for reinforcement learning research on unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). It is built upon [OmniDrones](https://github.com/btx0424/OmniDrones) and [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim), offering the following features:

- Efficiency: Achieve a simulation speed of up to 10<sup>7</sup> steps per second.
- Fidelity: Accurately replicate the physical environment, including physical laws, kinematics, and dynamics.
- Flexibility:  Ensure compatibility with existing RL frameworks and offer user-friendly APIs to facilitate seamless integration and usage.
- Evaluation: Assesses and contrasts various RL strategies through multiple tasks.

## Documentation (this repo)

Full in-repo documentation lives in **`docs/`**:

- **00-Overview.md** — Doc index, project files quick reference, and references to Test_AUV/docs for Isaac Sim 5 fixes.
- **01–12** — Package structure, robots, UnderwaterVehicle, views, actuators, controllers, environments, scripts/training, assets, hydrodynamics, installation/fixes, project files index.

Use it to understand every component (spawn, initialize, apply_action, get_state, hydro, T200, LeePositionController, Hover, train.py, BlueROV.yaml) and to integrate MarineGym with another project (e.g. Test_AUV).

## Installation

To install MarineGym, we recommend reading one of the following guides:
- [Installation from Source](https://marinegym.netlify.app/installation_from_source) (recommended for development)
- [Docker Environment](https://marinegym.netlify.app/docker_environment) (recommended for training purposes; no visualization interface)

If you encounter any issues, you can find solutions to common problems in the [FAQ](https://marinegym.netlify.app/faq) or feel free to open an issue.

For training and evaluation commands, please take a look at the [Quick Start](https://marinegym.netlify.app/quick_start).

## Usage
For installation details, please refer to our [Setup Guide](https://marinegym.netlify.app/installation_from_source/).

Currently, five gym environments are verified: Hover, Circle Tracking, Helical Tracking, Lemniscate Tracking, and Landing. Additional environments, including vision-based and sonar-based tasks, are under development.

The training script is located in the `scripts` folder, named `train.py`.


To start the training process, run:

```bash
python train.py task=Hover algo=ppo headless=false enable_livestream=false
```
where `task` specifies the training scenario, which can be `Hover`, `Track`, or `Landing`.
